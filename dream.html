  <section class="section">
    <p>Basketball has always been more than just a game to me — 
    it’s a dream that pushes me to be better every day. 
    It has taught me teamwork, discipline, and perseverance. 
    My dream is to inspire others the way my idols inspired me, 
    and to keep chasing greatness both on and off the court.</p>
